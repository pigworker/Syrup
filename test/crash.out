Circuits one and two are defined.

Truth table for one:
X { Z -> Z } Z
--{--------}--
0 { 0 -> 1 } 0
  { 1 -> 1 } 1
1 { 0 -> 1 } 0
  { 1 -> 0 } 1

Truth table for two:
X { Z Y -> Z Y } Z
--{------------}--
0 { 0 0 -> 1 1 } 0
  { 0 1 -> 1 1 } 0
  { 1 0 -> 1 1 } 1
  { 1 1 -> 1 1 } 1
1 { 0 0 -> 1 1 } 0
  { 0 1 -> 0 0 } 0
  { 1 0 -> 1 1 } 1
  { 1 1 -> 0 0 } 1

Bisimulation between one, two:
two can be distinguished from all possible states of one
when two has memory {10}
if one has memory like {1}, try inputs 0;1;0
if one has memory like {0}, try inputs 0

Bisimulation between two, one:
two can be distinguished from all possible states of one
when two has memory {10}
if one has memory like {1}, try inputs 0;1;0
if one has memory like {0}, try inputs 0
