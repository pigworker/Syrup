Circuit not is defined.

Circuit and is defined.

Circuit or is defined.

Found holes in circuit f:
  A : <Bit>
  B : <Bit>
  C : <Bit>
  D : [<Bit>, <Bit>]

Circuit f has been stubbed out.

I was trying to make sense of the following code:

problematic() = ?

I got stuck here: 
  problematic() =  {HERE} ? 
I was looking for a definition.
At that point, it made sense, but then I found stuff I didn't expect.

You haven't defined problematic just now.

Circuit problematic has been stubbed out.
