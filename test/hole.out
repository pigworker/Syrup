Circuit and is defined.

Circuit or is defined.

Found holes in circuit f:
  ?A : <Bit>
  ?B : <Bit>
  ?C : <Bit>
  ?D : [<Bit>, <Bit>]

Warning: Circuit f has been stubbed out.

Error: I was trying to make sense of the following code:

problematic() = ?

I got stuck here: 
  problematic() =  {HERE} ? 
I was looking for a definition.
At that point, it made sense, but then I found stuff I didn't expect.

Error: You haven't defined the circuit problematic just now.

Warning: Circuit problematic has been stubbed out.
