Error: I was trying to make sense of the following code:

hadd(<Bit>,<Bit>) -> <Bit>,<Bit>
hadd(x,y) = a2, b1 where
  a2 = and(x,y)
  a1 = xor(x,y)


Error: You tried to use b1 but it is not in scope.

Warning: Circuit hadd has been stubbed out.

Circuit fadd is defined.

Warning: the wire a1 is defined but never used.

Error: You haven't defined the circuit tripleAddTwo just now.

Warning: Circuit tripleAddTwo has been stubbed out.

Error: I was trying to make sense of the following code:

tripleAddTwo

I got stuck here: 
   {HERE} tripleAddTwo
