not is defined.

I was trying to make sense of the following code:

not2(<Bit>) -> <Bit>
not2(c) = !C


Error: You tried to use C but it is not in scope.
Did you mean: c?


not2 has been stubbed out.

Warning: You are redefining the top-level variable nand.

nand is defined.

Warning: the wire N is defined but never used.

I was trying to make sense of the following code:

and(<Bit>,<Bit>) -> <Bit>
and(X,Y) = !n where

  N = nand(X,Y)


Error: You tried to use n but it is not in scope.
Did you mean: N?


and has been stubbed out.

or is defined.

xor is defined.

h1 is defined.

Warning: the wires CIN, CiN are defined but never used.

I was trying to make sense of the following code:

f1(<Bit>,<Bit>) -> <Bit>,<Bit>
f1(X,Y,CIN) = Cin,Z where

  CIN   = xor(CiN, CIn)
  CiN,Z = h1(D,CIn)
  CIn,D = h1(X,Y)


Error: You are redefining the local variable CIN.
Error: You tried to use Cin but it is not in scope.
Did you mean one of these: CIN, CIn, CiN?


f1 has been stubbed out.

tff is defined.
