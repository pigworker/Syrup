Circuit `not` is defined.

Error: I was trying to make sense of the following code:
  not2(<Bit>) -> <Bit>
  not2(c) = !C
  
Error: You tried to use C but it is not in scope.
Did you mean: c?

Warning: Circuit `not2` has been stubbed out.

Error: You are redefining the top-level variable nand.

Warning: the wire N is defined but never used.

Error: I was trying to make sense of the following code:
  and(<Bit>,<Bit>) -> <Bit>
  and(X,Y) = !n where
  
    N = nand(X,Y)
  
Error: You tried to use n but it is not in scope.
Did you mean: N?

Error: I was trying to make sense of the following code:

  f1(X,Y,CIN) = Cin,Z where

    CiN,Z = h1(D,CIn)

Error: You are redefining the local variable CIN.
Error: You tried to use Cin but it is not in scope.
Did you mean one of these: CIN, CIn, CiN?
