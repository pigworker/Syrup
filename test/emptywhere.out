Warning: empty where clause in the definition of and.
Did you forget to indent the block of local definitions using spaces?


Error: I was trying to make sense of the following code:

and(<Bit>,<Bit>) -> <Bit>
and(X,Y) = notnand where


Error: You tried to use notnand but it is not in scope.


Warning: Circuit and has been stubbed out.


Error: I was trying to make sense of the following code:

notnand = nand(nand(X,Y),nand(X,Y))

I got stuck here: 
  ... notnand  {HERE} = nand(nand(X,Y),nand(X,Y))  ...
I was looking for a component template.
At that point, I was hoping for (..) but I found = which vexed me.
