one is defined.

two is defined.

Truth table for one:
0 { 0 -> 1 } 0
  { 1 -> 1 } 1
1 { 0 -> 1 } 0
  { 1 -> 0 } 1

Truth table for two:
0 { 00 -> 11 } 0
  { 01 -> 11 } 0
  { 10 -> 11 } 1
  { 11 -> 11 } 1
1 { 00 -> 11 } 0
  { 01 -> 00 } 0
  { 10 -> 11 } 1
  { 11 -> 00 } 1

two can be distinguished from all possible states of one
when two has memory {10}
if one has memory like {1}, try inputs 0;1;0
if one has memory like {0}, try inputs 0
